# GUIServerMonitor
It`s created to show in GUI all parameters of our server(i`ts cpu load, ram etc)

/* deprecated, 
*If you want to test it, necessarily is to upload 3 files what are in pack <ServerStatus.7zip> 
*directly to home directory of your user with what you want to connect. 
*/

Now just download for your windows pack ServerStatus.7zip, extract and start ServerStatus.exe

I suggest to create new user for this.
